# TensorImage
![Example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PAqzvCxPjpDN8RC9HQw45w.jpeg) 


__TensorImage__ is and open source library for image classification for easily training and deploying models.

## Features
- Image classification model training. A wide range of data augmentation operations to boost testing accuracy and preventing overfitting are available

- Training clusters -- making feature engineering easier and faster by automatically comparing performance of different models with varying hyperpameters

- Easy to use and manage -- all files, data and trained models are stored inside your workspace directory, keeping everything organized

- Large-scale deployment of trained image classification models -- generating more training data for further improved classification

## Installation
From the terminal:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/TensorImage/tensorimage.git
```
Once downloaded, move or copy the folder to ```~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/```. Then, install the dependencies from ```requirements.txt```. From the terminal:
```shell
$ cp -r tensorimage ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/
$ cd ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorimage
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
