__TensorImage__ is and open source image classification library designed to easily train and deploy models.

The main features are:
- Image classification model training. A wide range of data augmentation operations to boost testing accuracy and prevent overfitting are available

- Training clusters -- makes hyperparameter tuning easier and faster by automatically comparing performance of different models

- Organization -- all files, data and trained models are automatically stored and ordered inside your workspace directory which can be accessed at any time

- Large-scale deployment of trained image classification models -- generating more training data for further improved classification

### Installation
From the terminal:
```shell
$ pip3 install tensorimage
```
